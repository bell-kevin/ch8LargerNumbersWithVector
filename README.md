# ch8LargerNumbersWithVector

This project is very similar to the first one, except it uses a vector instead of an array. Copy the root folder of the previous project. Instead of an array of fixed size of 25, ask the user how many random numbers to generate. Declare a vector of unknown size, and use the push-back method to add the random numbers. Ask the user which number to test, and validate that the input is between 1 and 100. Use a function to go through the vector to count how many numbers are larger than the user's input. Be sure to modify the output to reflect that this project uses a vector and a user-specified number of numbers.

Example of the result with valid input:

![Ch 8 Proj2](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch8LargerNumbersWithVector/blob/main/ch8LargerNumbersWithVector/vector.PNG)

Example of the result with invalid input:

![Ch 8 Proj2 errors](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch8LargerNumbersWithVector/blob/main/ch8LargerNumbersWithVector/vectorInputValidation.PNG)

Take screenshots similar to those seen here, one with no errors in input, one with errors in input.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
